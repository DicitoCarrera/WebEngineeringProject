### First code snippet

fetch("http://localhost:5001/lessons") .then((response) => response.json())
.then((data) => { const lessonsContainer = document.getElementById(
"lessons-container", );

    data.forEach((lesson) => {
      console.log(`lesson.title: ${lesson.title}`);
      if (lesson.title === lessonTitel) {
        const lessonElement = document.createElement("article");
        lessonElement.classList.add("post");
        lessonElement.innerHTML = `
                          <header>
                              <div class="title">

                                  <p>${lesson.description}</p>
                              </div>

require(["vs/editor/editor.main"], function () { const editorContainer =
document.getElementById("editor-container"); const languageSelector =
document.getElementById("language-selector"); let editor;

    function createEditor(language) {
      editor = monaco.editor.create(editorContainer, {
        value: [
          "function helloWorld() {",
          '\tconsole.log("Hello, world!");',
          "}",
