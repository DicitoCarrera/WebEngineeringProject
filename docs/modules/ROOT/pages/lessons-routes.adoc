# Lessons Routes Documentation

This document provides an overview of the lessons routes in the application. These routes handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) for managing lessons in the database. The routes are defined using Express.js and interact with a SQLite database.

## Routes Overview

The routes in this section are part of the **lessonsRoutes** and are responsible for managing lessons in the system. The following operations are supported:

- **POST /lessons**: Create a new lesson.
- **GET /lessons**: Retrieve all lessons.
- **GET /lessons/:id**: Retrieve a specific lesson by ID.
- **PUT /lessons/:id**: Update a specific lesson by ID.
- **DELETE /lessons/:id**: Delete a specific lesson by ID.

## Conclusion

These routes provide essential CRUD operations for managing lessons in the application. They enable users to create, retrieve, update, and delete lesson data in a simple and efficient manner. The interactions with the database are handled using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection and ensure data integrity.
