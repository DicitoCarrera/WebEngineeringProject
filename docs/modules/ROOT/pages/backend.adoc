= Backend Service - entry point (backend.js)

== Overview
This document provides a technical overview of the `backend.js` entry point for the backend service in the application. The file sets up an Express.js server that handles routing, middleware, authentication, and session management for the backend application.

== Dependencies
The `backend.js` file uses the following dependencies:

- **express**: A web framework for Node.js, used to create the server and handle routing.
- **body-parser**: Middleware to parse incoming request bodies.
- **express-session**: Middleware for managing user sessions.
- **cookie-parser**: Middleware for parsing cookies in incoming requests.
- **usersRoutes**: Custom routes for authentication-related operations.
- **lessonsRoutes**: Custom routes for lesson-related operations.

== Server Configuration

The server is configured to listen on port 5000. The following middleware and routes are used in the backend service:

=== Express App Initialization
The server is initialized using the Express framework:

```javascript
const app = express();
```

=== Middleware Configuration

cookieParser: Parses cookies from incoming requests.

```javascript
app.use(cookieParser());

```

bodyParser.urlencoded: Parses URL-encoded bodies (e.g., form submissions).

```javascript
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
```

bodyParser.json: Parses incoming requests with JSON payloads.

```javascript
app.use(bodyParser.json());
```

session: Initializes session handling using express-session. It uses a secret key for encrypting the session data and stores session data in memory.

```javascript
app.use(session({
  secret: "your_secret_key",
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true,
  cookie: { secure: false },  // Set to true if using HTTPS
}));
```

=== Routes

usersRoutes: Handles all authentication-related routes, such as login and registration.

lessonsRoutes: Handles routes related to lessons, like retrieving and managing lessons.

```javascript
app.use("/auth", usersRoutes);
app.use("/lessons", lessonsRoutes);
```

=== Protected Route

A sample protected route (/protected) is defined. The route checks if the user is authenticated by verifying the existence of a session user:

```javascript
app.get('/protected', (req, res) => {
  if (req.session.user) {
    res.send('Welcome to the protected area');
  } else {
    res.status(401).send('Unauthorized access');
  }
});
```

This route checks the session for an authenticated user. If the user is authenticated (i.e., req.session.user exists), it sends a welcome message. Otherwise, it sends a 401 Unauthorized error.

=== Middleware Function: logRequest

A custom middleware function is defined to log each incoming request, including the HTTP method and the IP address of the requester.

```javascript
const logRequest = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Received a ${req.method} request from ${req.ip}`);
  next();
};
```

This middleware is applied to all incoming requests by using app.use(logRequest).

=== Server Listening

Finally, the Express server is configured to listen on port 5000, and logs a message when the server starts:

```javascript
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

== Conclusion

This backend.js file sets up an Express.js server with basic functionality, including middleware for parsing requests, managing user sessions, and logging incoming requests. It also provides protected routes and integrates authentication and lesson-related routes through custom modules (usersRoutes and lessonsRoutes). This server is essential for the backend service of the application and ensures secure, session-based interactions for users.
